## Description
This project's aim is to bring the barrier for entry to robotics down, built from low cost and easy available parts. The fact it's completely open source means anyone can make their own changes and publish it as they please.

## Directions
To use this software:
1. Assemble all of the main body of the robot dog including wiring
2. Run calibration sketch and once servos stop moving turn arduino back off.
3. Assemble legs so they point straight down. (It is advised to check there are no shorts at this point to avoid damaging your computer.)
4. Run calibration sketch again this time with it plugged into the serial monitor.
5. The default value is 90, adjust this by typing numbers around this into the SM till the leg is straight.
6. Type n to go to the next leg and repeat step 5 till all legs are calibrated.
7. Run the main sketch and start editing it to suit you.
