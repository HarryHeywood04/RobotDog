## Description
This project's aim is to bring the barrier for entry to robotics down, built from low cost and easy available parts. The fact it's completely open source means anyone can make their own changes and publish it as they please.

## Directions
To use this software:
1. Assemble the main body and wiring
2. Plug in servos (don't attach them to the robot just yet)
3. Either send calibrate over serial or use the app, connect it to the bluetooth and press calibrate, then turn off the robot
4. Screw the servos in and attach the legs in an L shape towards the front
5. Turn the robot back on and run calibrate again, if on the app select each servo and calibrate them so they are at perfect 90 degree angles. If on serial, use commands s0-s7 (select servo), a70-110 (set the angle of the servo), c to confirm and x to cancel
6. Once calibrated you can start messing around with the robot
